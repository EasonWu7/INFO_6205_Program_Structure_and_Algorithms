In a given directed graph, we can find a valid topological ordering for the sequence shown below:\n\nWe start at node A because A has no incoming edges.\nThen move to node D, since D is pointed to by A and no other node depends on D.\nNext is node B, since B is pointed to by A and no other node depends on B.\nThen there is node E, since E is pointed to by D and no other node depends on E.\nThis is followed by node F, since F is pointed to by B and E and no other node depends on F.\nFinally, we reach node C because C is pointed to by F and no other node depends on C.\n\nThis topological ordering satisfies the requirements of topological ordering in that all edges are left-to-right and there is no violation of the direction of the edges in the directed graph. Thus, this is a valid topological ordering for a given directed graph.Topological ordering is often used to represent dependencies or order of computation of tasks, ensuring that tasks are performed in the correct order. In this case, the above topological ordering represents a way to execute the nodes in the graph in order without violating the dependencies.",

This approach minimizes the script's length while preserving the poem's content and structure.\n\nThe specific optimization strategy and encoding techniques may vary depending on the complexity of the poem or song, but the key is to identify common elements and reference them efficiently in the script.",

We know from the inductive hypothesis that for any binary tree with n nodes, the number of nodes with exactly one child is equal to the number of internal nodes.\n\nNow, let's add one more node to the tree. There are two possible scenarios:\n\n1.The new node becomes a leaf (i.e., it has no children). In this case, the number of nodes with exactly one child remains the same, and the number of internal nodes increases by one. The statement still holds because we have not changed the existing structure.\n\n2.The new node becomes an internal node with exactly one child. In this case, the number of nodes with exactly one child increases by one, and the number of internal nodes also increases by one. Again, the statement continues to hold.\n\nIn both scenarios, the equality between the number of nodes with exactly one child and the number of internal nodes is preserved. Since we know from the inductive hypothesis that the equality holds for binary trees with n nodes, this relationship continues to hold for binary trees with (n+1) nodes.\n\nTherefore, by induction, we can conclude that in any binary tree, the number of nodes with exactly one child is equal to the number of internal nodes (non-leaf nodes).",

This is important for saving storage space or transmitting data.\n    7.Learned how to use mathematical induction to prove the relationship of node attributes in a binary tree and How to construct a proof of mathematical induction, including the basic case, the induction hypothesis, and the steps of induction.\n    8.Learned how to design an efficient algorithm to detect whether a sequence can form a subsequence by removing zero or more elements from another sequence.",
